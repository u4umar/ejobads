Description
-----------
This module provides web site admins the ability to display Google AdSense
ads on their web site, thus earning revenue.


Prerequisites
-------------
You must signup for a Google AdSense account.


Installation
------------
To install, copy the adsense directory and all its contents to your modules
directory.


Configuration
-------------
To enable this module, visit Administration -> Extend, and enable adsense,
and one of the other modules in the Adsense group.  The modules marked as
'(old)' are not using the new 'Managed Ads' feature of Google AdSense, so
you should only use them if you have ads in the old format or if you know
what you're doing.

To configure it, go to Administration > Configuration > Web services > AdSense

Follow the online instructions on that page on how to display ads and the
various ways to do so.
